# CS_2024_project

## Description

This project is a Python tool that automatically generates a custom Codeforces-style contest for any group of users. It collects each participant’s solved problems using the Codeforces API, filters out tasks they have already completed, and then selects new unsolved problems based on chosen tags and rating ranges. The program ensures all selected tasks are fresh, relevant, and personalized to the users’ skill levels, making it useful for practice groups, teams, and competitive programming training.

## Setup

Describe the steps to set up the environment and run the application. This can be a bash script or docker commands.

```
Your commands

```

## Requirements

Describe technologies, libraries, languages you are using (this can be updated in the future).

## Features

Describe the main features the application performs.
Filters out previously solved tasks and selects only unsolved ones.

Allows choosing problem tags (e.g., dp, graphs, math) for targeted practice.

Supports rating-range filtering (e.g., 1200–1700).

Randomly generates a contest of any desired size (e.g., 5–10 problems).

Produces direct links to all selected Codeforces problems.

Works for one user or multiple users (team practice).

## Git

Specify which branch will store the latest stable version of the application

## Success Criteria

Describe the criteria by which the success of the project can be determined
(this will be updated in the future)
